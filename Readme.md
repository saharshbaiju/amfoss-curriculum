### Task-01 


I have documented my complete Task-01 for Anveshan in a Medium blog, where I explain my approach and how I solved each Git exercise. The write-up includes the commands I used, my approach, and how did it.This exercises helped me to improve my  understanding of concepts like branching, rebasing, and bisecting through commit history.
