# Task-05

My goal was to create the frontend of Melofi website as per the design created early in task-04. All my components are dynamic meaning it adjust itself with json input from api call an backend.

My approach: At first I only had some idea about html and css but no idea about js or react.So it was kinda strugle at first then decided to stick to any one source to learn and found 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) playlist of react tutorial videos.and watched 29 videos.(most of them where less that 10min).

**Strongly recommend to setup backend also before testing frontend** since all features like playlist,recentlyplayed and login pages depend on them all necessary steps to setup mysql for melofi are give in the Readme of task-06 <br>
