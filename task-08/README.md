### Task-08

The task was demanding to build a unix like terminal using C. <br>

At beginning I had no idea how to start, so I started searching for resources and found a three part blog by [Indradhanush Gupta](https://igupta.in/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-1)
where he explained all core logics like fork() using exe function in my shell i used execvp().I clarified my further doubt using youtube and google. <br>

In my shell I have implemented the following:<br>
- All basic error handling
- Signal handling for ctrl-c and ctrl-z
- Background process using &
<br>
